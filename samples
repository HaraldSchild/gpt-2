======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
 I[33M] want to ask a coworker [33F]of one month out but I don't know if my behavior has lowered my chances.

There is this woman I worked with that I felt an attraction towards. The work we did didn't allow for much conversation so let's just say I know next to nothing about her.

There are some things she does that makes me think she is interested in me. For example, I notice her looking at me quite often. Also, she seems kind of shy around me.

However, there are somethings that she also does that makes me think she doesn't like me. She has never made an attempt to talk to me. And she sometimes seems uncomfortable around me. I'm not sure if this is due to her shyness or if she genuinely does not like me.

One day I got into a fight with the boss and abruptly quit. No one at work, including the girl that I liked, knows why I quit.

But about a month after I returned to work working on a different shift. I know longer saw the girl that I liked except once in a while when we change shifts. One time I was late and running into the workplace when I saw her walking towards the bathroom. Immediately I made a left turn so it looked like I was avoiding her.

In my peripheral vision I saw her waving towards me but I ignored it. I think this might have been seen as my rejection of her. I've since realized what a huge mistake it was because it would have given me a chance to clear the air about my reasons for quitting.

Now i want to give her my number and have her call me to see if we can have something outside of work. I'm not sure if what I did was bad enough that she has just turned off towards the idea of going out with me.

Animation major isn't working for me, what should I do?

I'm currently in a 4 year program in digital animation, when I was younger I wanted to work with 3D modeling and hopefully work with video games as a career choice. 
However, I'm starting to realize this might not be something I want to do, it's not the workload that's making me question it but I'm not really too skilled with using the programs the school gave us and I have what my professors said "average" drawing talent and I went though heavy depression during the first year of college. I had a backup plan to major into History (a subject I've very good at) and become a teacher if this didn't work out but I'm afraid of talking to my parents and uncle (who are helping me pay for college) about making such a drastic change two years into college. Is there anyone in the same boat as me or anyone who could help me out?

I [23/F] haven't heard from the guy [26/M] I've been seeing for the past 2.5 months in a few days...feeling confused

I've been seeing this guy I met at a local bar for around 2.5 months now. Things have been good-we have not put a label on anything, but we've been seeing each other once or twice a week (he travels for work and I just started a new job, so we're both pretty busy) and have had a great time. He has-based on general enthusiasm while being around me and physical affection-given me the impression that he is into me and I am happy to take it slow as far as labels and such go. This weekend, he cancelled a date we had planned and after I said I wasn't free later that weekend because I had a work meeting to prepare for, he stopped texting me back. We do usually talk a bit via text every day and he often initiates these conversations, but it's been radio silence for 3 days now, after he didn't text me back over the weekend.

Last year, I got out of a 4 year relationship, so I am pretty new to the dating game and feeling a bit confused. I don't know if I am overthinking this because I like the guy or if something is up and I should consider asking him about it. Any insight or advice would greatly be appreciated, Reddit!

Frank Lampard has revealed he'd 'love' to see a gay footballer come out and be fully respected by the public, saying that the game is changing and losing it's macho persona.

Taking part on Channel Four's 'Alan Carr's Chatty Man' alongside Denise van Outen, Noel Fielding and Lethal Bizzle, the on-loan Manchester City star spoke of his support and feels that football in evolving for the better.

When host Carr said: 'Do you think we will ever see a gay footballer? Statistically there should be loads. One in ten are gay aren't they? Fifty-thousand professional footballers, one of them must be.'

Frank Lampard showed his support for gay footballers in an interview on Alan Carr's Chatty Man

LA Galaxy Robbie Rogers (left) came out as being gay and was heavily supported by the sporting world

Former West Ham United midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger also came out as being gay not long after Rogers

Lampard responded: 'Well we have had a couple. Thomas Hitzlsperger who played in the Premier League, came out after having moved back to Germany or Italy. 'In America, Robbie Rogers played there.

'I think a lot of the problem is, as you say, it's a fact that it will be out there, as it is in all modern life at all times, but I think we are probably at fault as a sport.

'I think that it's that old syndrome where it's a mans game and you can't talk about that. I have to say the game's changing a lot. There are a lot of campaigns. I feel it in the dressing room. There's a different feel about it.

'Yeah there should be. I would love it if someone came out and everyone treated it with respect. You know that thing about 'we're macho we play football,' is very old hat.'

With Lampard's career nearing the end, the New York City man is already thinking about what his next step will be - refusing to rule out the chance of becoming a manager.

He said: 'I'll maybe do my coaching badges which is a bit of a process as that's two years worth of work to get that and maybe be a manager but I'm not completely sure whether to go down that route or down certain other routes- bit of TV maybe.

The City midfielder was joined on the show by Noel Fielding (left, Lethal Bizzle and Denis van Outen

'Everyone's lining up to do that at the moment you know the punditry thing is the thing to do. Everyone that retires wants to go in, and it's not an easy thing. It looks quite easy to talk about football but it's not.'

Following England's disappointing 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Carr pressed Lampard on why we perform so bad - despite the quality in the country.

The "F" word in the first sentence is always a big deal.

In that case, we need to look at the question, "Why did you choose to say that?" In this case, it's not just "because it was a good idea." Rather, it's because it was the right thing to do.

If it turns out that the "F" word is the right thing to do, then "I was a good friend."

The "F" word in the second sentence is always a big deal.

I know what you're thinking. Why are you saying that?

It wasn't that, but the "F" word in the second sentence is always a big deal.

"The first name of your girlfriend might be 'Bobby.'"

Well, it's true that you could always choose to say that, since that's what you said in the first place.

But, instead of saying "I am a good friend of your girlfriend," you could say "I was a good friend of your girlfriend's boyfriend."

You could also say "I was a good friend of my girlfriend's husband."

It's not that you couldn't say that in the first place, though. You could do it.

But, I'm sure you're not going to believe me.

You're probably not going to be able to say "I am good friend of your girlfriend's husband."

That would be ridiculous.

Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon has no immediate plans to retire and said it would be a waste to quit now when he feels he is still in top form.

'A player stops when he feels that he is no longer what he was before on the pitch,' Buffon, 37, told reporters after Juventus beat Monaco 1-0 in the Champions League on Tuesday.

'Looking at it objectively, that is not my case. I will continue to keep playing as long as I am doing well, otherwise it would be a waste. Why bid farewell to football if you are playing well?'

Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon says he is not thinking about retiring because he is still playing well

The Italy international produced a solid display to stop Monaco from scoring an away goal on Tuesday night

The Juventus captain celebrates after his side recorded a 1-0 win in the first leg of the quarter-final

'At the first sign of slipping, I would be the first to bow out. I think one should stop playing when goes onto the field and you see that you are no longer the same person,' he added.

Buffon, who has helped Juventus win three successive Serie A titles and is still Italy's first-choice goalkeeper, made three important saves to deny Monaco an away goal in Tuesday's game.

Buffon joined Juventus from Parma in 2001, and stayed with them even after they were demoted to Serie B following the Calciopoli match-fixing scandal in 2006, the same year he helped Italy win the World Cup.

Nico Rosberg is too polite to say what precisely he finds irritating about the team-mate with whom he is locked in the battle of his career.

Sitting in an air-conditioned room away from the dry heat of the Bahrain paddock, he goes so far as to say this of Lewis Hamilton: 'I know exactly how he is functioning. I understand him really, really well. All his attitudes. I can tell why he is doing whatever he is doing. Sometimes he annoys me. Some character traits.'

Go on, then, tell us what it is that gets under your skin.

Lewis Hamilton waves after qualifying on pole position for the Bahrain Grand Prix on Saturday

Hamilton's Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg was third six-tenths of a second behind Hamilton

Hamilton has dominated Roberg this season and has got pole in every race during the current campaign

'I don't want to give details,' says Rosberg, diplomatic to the core.

At this point the door of the Mercedes hospitality area, in which Rosberg and I are sitting alone, opens fast and loudly. It is Hamilton invading the quiet of the interview. He turns to face the door he has just walked through and slammed shut, his head down, and shouts in an almost childlike way: 'Phew, phew, man, it's hot,' deporting himself as if he is about to pass out from heat stroke.

'You see...?' says Rosberg, his eyebrows arched.

A complaint about an unsatisfactory milkshake served at a Louisiana branch of Burger King quickly turned ugly when the employee threatened the unhappy customer with a slap.

Cell phone footage, recorded by the unnamed customer, starts with the woman repeatedly asking to speak to the manager to complain about the quality of a milkshake that she had just been served.

After four separate requests to speak to a manager, the customer finally got the employee's attention.

A complaint about an unsatisfactory milkshake served at a Louisiana branch of Burger King quickly turned ugly when the employee started cursing before getting physical with the customer

The customer then asked for a refund, but the exchange quickly descended into a heated argument and the member of staff starts to curse at the customer.

'Baby, you're about to get it,' the employee is heard saying. 'Just wait. You're gonna get your s***.'

'You're cursing,' the customer replied. 'Are you serious? Are you serious?'

'You cannot treat people like this, this is your job,' she continued. 'Are you for real?'

'No, I'm fake,' the employee snapped back. The footage, first posted on Live Leak, claims to have been taken on Tuesday at a branch in Lake Charles.

'I don't know what happened to you today. And I'm sorry, but you handed me soft serve ice cream and then gave me some garbage and I'm not going to eat it,' the customer explained. 'And you're rude.'

'I don't give a f***, go ahead,' the angry employee replied.

The Arkansas judge who posted private details of Charlize Theron's adoption of her son has been forced to hand in his law licence because of a bribery conviction in a separate case.

By surrendering his licence, circuit Judge Michael Maggio has avoided a disciplinary hearing over the conviction, for which he faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine when he is sentenced in July.

Maggio, 52, sparked controversy last March when he admitted posting a series of comments that were racist, sexist and offensive towards the LGBT community over the past several years.

Charlize Theron pictured with Jackson, the boy she adopted from her native South Africa. Michael Maggio revealed the Hollywood actress had adopted two months before she announced it publically

Theron with her partner Sean Penn. Maggio initially pretended a friend had been the judge who oversaw the star's adoption hearing

Using the under the pseudonym 'geauxjudge', Maggio made the comments on the on a Louisiana State University fan message board.

His comments in January 2012 divulged details of Theron's adoption - two months before she publicly released the information.

On the message board, Maggio said a 'judge friend' had handled Theron's adoption, before admitting that he was also involved in the case.

I was showing my boyfriend photos from Greece when I was there a few years ago. he is a big history buff so we cuddled in bed and looked through the photos. I was there with my black boyfriend so he was of course in a lot of those photos. my new boyfriend asked who he was and when I said it was my ex-boyfriend he replied with a pained "oh ok" so we stopped looking at photos and watched some netflix instead.

he got really quiet and didnt want to cuddle anymore, he just sat and read a book. after a few hours i just had to ask
him what was up with his reaction to the photos with my boyfriend?

He said something like "why would you even date me? if you like black guys so much why don't you date black guys? what's the point of being with me? im not your type"

I didn't even know I had a type. I just thought he was cute and nice so we dated. He didn't like my answer, got upset, we fought and he left.

I don't really understand his reaction, it was actually very shocking. He has never come off as racist in the year I have known him, more like the opposite. He is a really sweet and fun guy and this was very out of character for him.
